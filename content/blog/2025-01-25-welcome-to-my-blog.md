Welcome to my new blog! After years of having a static website, I've finally set up a proper blogging system using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

<!-- more -->

## Why Zola?

I chose Zola for a few reasons:

- **Simple and fast** - Static site generation with no runtime dependencies
- **Markdown-based** - Easy to write and maintain content
- **Great templating** - Tera templates are powerful and flexible
- **Built-in features** - Pagination, taxonomies, and RSS feeds out of the box

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Programming and technology
- Unix/Linux tips and tricks
- Photography and creative projects
- Random thoughts and discoveries

## The Setup

This blog is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions:
1. Write a markdown post in `content/blog/`
2. Push to the `main` branch
3. GitHub Actions builds the site with Zola
4. Deploys to the `gh-pages` branch
5. GitHub Pages serves the updated site

Pretty slick! No more manual HTML editing.
